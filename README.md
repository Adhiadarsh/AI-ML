# AI-ML
Hello Tarun,

I’m an AI engineer with 3+ years of experience building ML systems that operate in real-world, production environments.
My work spans model development, data pipelines, and system-level integration, with a strong focus on scalability, performance, and reliability.
I’m particularly interested in logistics and world-model style problems involving prediction, optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty.
I enjoy working close to the problem, iterating fast, and translating research ideas into deployable systems. 
I’m excited about applying ML and simulation-driven approaches to complex logistics workflows in a zero-to-one startup environment.
